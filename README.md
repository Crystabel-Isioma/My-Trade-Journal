## Insights

- Win rate is high at **82%**, indicating strong trade execution and effective strategies.
- The **volatility index of 82.71** shows trades occurred in highly volatile market conditions, yet ROI remained positive.
- **Monthly ROI peaked in March** and declined in April, pointing to possible inconsistency or emotional trading.
- **10x leverage** was the most commonly used and aligned with the highest ROI outcomes.
- **Losing trades were fewer but had notable ROI drops**, emphasizing the need for tighter loss control.
- **Top-performing coins** included LAI/USDT, USUAL/USDT, and SAFE/USDT, suggesting reliable setups or strategies.
- **Winning trades produced significantly higher ROI** than the losses incurred from losing trades.

## Recommendations

- Stick to strategies that delivered high win rates and positive ROI, particularly those used in winning trades.
- Avoid setups with lower risk-reward ratios and unverified entry signals that led to losses.
- Use **10x leverage** consistently, as it was linked to optimal performance.
- Strengthen trade entry rules to reduce decision-making based on emotions or market noise.
- Focus more on coins with strong historical performance and monitor their recurring patterns.
- Continue tracking and analyzing trades monthly to adjust strategies based on performance trends.
